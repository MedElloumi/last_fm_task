21th September 2018: When there is a will there's a way ...

While the task dont suggest to use recyclerView or gridView for the main screen fragment and albums overview fragment I choosed to use:

main screen fragment: recyclerView

albums fragment: gridView

While the task also dont suggest a way to save/delete an album from localstorage I used a ratingBar star to handle that.

I have included some comments especially within fragments/adapters which I think they can give an over view on how I think and how I develop.
