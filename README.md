What happened after solving this task ?

I have been invited to an on site interview. I have been asked to solve a small puzzle, The interview atmosphere was positive.

An experience that I learnt a lot from.

While the task dont suggest to use recyclerView or gridView for the main screen fragment and albums overview fragment I choosed to use:

main screen fragment: recyclerView

albums fragment: gridView

While the task also dont suggest a way to save/delete an album from localstorage I used a ratingBar star to handle that.

I have included some comments especially within fragments/adapters which I think they can give an over view on how I think and how I develop.
